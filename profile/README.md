## Open source code for algorithms for quantum computers

So far our main repositories are:

- [QAOA](https://github.com/OpenQuantumComputing/QAOA): This package is a flexible python implementation of the [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028.pdf) /[Quantum Alternating Operator ansatz](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.03489.pdf)  (QAOA) **aimed at researchers** to readily test the performance of a new ansatz, a new classical optimizers
- [QRC](https://github.com/OpenQuantumComputing/quantumreservoirpy): Using quantum circuits as reservoirs in reservoir computing is fairly new. The current examples in the literature rely heavily on quantum circuits of a very periodic nature. This package is meant to simplify the creation and simulation of such periodic circuits.
- [VQE](https://github.com/OpenQuantumComputing/chemistry): Algorithms for calculating energy spectra of molecules
